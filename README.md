Enhancing Financial Fraud Detection Using Behavioral Analytics

📌 Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

🚀 Leveraging Behavioral Analytics for Smarter Fraud Detection

🔍 Overview

Financial fraud is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often bypassing traditional detection systems that rely solely on transaction rules. This project introduces an ML-driven fraud detection system that leverages behavioral analytics to identify anomalous transaction patterns, improving fraud detection accuracy.

🛠️ Key Features

✅ Behavioral Analytics: Tracks transaction patterns over time for anomaly detection
✅ Machine Learning Models: Implements Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and ANN
✅ Dimensionality Reduction: Uses PCA & t-SNE for improved model performance
✅ Imbalance Handling: Applies SMOTE to balance fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions
✅ Real-World Application: Detects fraud based on transaction amount, frequency, location, and timing

📊 Methodology

1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Data preprocessing & visualization of fraud patterns
	•	Feature engineering based on transaction behavior

2️⃣ Feature Selection & Engineering:
	•	Extracts transaction frequency, time intervals, spending habits, etc.
	•	Applies dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) for pattern discovery

3️⃣ Model Development:
	•	Trained and evaluated Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and ANN
	•	Compared performance using accuracy, precision-recall, and AUC-ROC

4️⃣ Fraud Detection & Validation:
	•	Applied SMOTE to handle data imbalance
	•	Deployed an optimized fraud classification model
